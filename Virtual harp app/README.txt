Instruction on how to play with Virtual_harp (Connected Kinect sensor is prerequisite for this App ):


1. Download and install processing and pure data. 

2. Before running the program, put "FingerTracker" into the directory "Processing/libraries".

3. The "Virtual_harp" folder contains the main program. Open up the Processing and activate "Virtual_harp.pde".

4. Also open pure data file "harp_sound.pd" and check DSP box.

5. The program runs over the Kinect camera, so wait a while till the red spot appeared.

6. Move your fingers to play the harp strings to make different sound pitch, and click the mouse to play the background music to accompany with the instrument play.

7. Adjust the harp volume by press ‘Up’ arrow or ‘Down’ arrow; adjust the threshold value to adapt the distance between Kinect and your body by press ‘Left’ arrow or ‘Right’ arrow. 

Sometime the program throw an error message of ’NullPointerException’, to solve this issue just stop the program and move your body closer to the Kinect camera and stand still for a second then run the program again.
The default threshold value is 800, it is about 2 or 3 feet away in the front of Kinect camera when it starts.
